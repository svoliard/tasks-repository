    <h1>PRIMARCS</h1>
    <div>The Primarchs were the twenty genetically-engineered "sons" of the Emperor of Mankind, and the genetic
        "fathers" of the Space Marine Legions. <a href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Malcador_the_Sigillite"
            target="_blank" id="info"> The
            Emperor </a> used his own DNA in their creation, and they were designed to
        be far superior to the average human: immensely larger, stronger, hardier, faster, and more intelligent.
        They
        were also incredibly charismatic, as their main role was to be generals and leaders of the Imperial
        military.
        Each had their own purpose and specialty, allowing them to serve in specific functions that the Emperor's
        forces
        would need in reconquering the galaxy.
