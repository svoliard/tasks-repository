                    <h1>History of Winemaking</h1>
                    <p>The art of winemaking has been around since as early as 7000 BC. Over the years the process
                        spread throughout the world.Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermentation of grape
                        juice. The chemical reaction involves yeast, converting the sugar of the grapes into ethanol, an
                        alcohol. Winemaking is an art as there are countless different types of grapes to use, as well
                        as different types of yeasts. A vintner, a person who makes wine, is able to control how their
                        grapes develop, using selective breeding techniques to control which traits will carry on and
                        which traits will die, ultimately creating their own unique grape strain which gives their a
                        wine a unique taste.The earliest evidence of wine in the world was found in Georgia from 6000
                        BC. An earlier 7000 BC find from China was very similar to Wine, it was a Grape based fermented
                        drink. Wine was also found in Iran from 5000 BC and in Sicily from 4000 BC. The earliest
                        evidence of a steady production of Wine is found to be from 4100 BC in Armenia where the
                        earliest winery was found. Vintners used their feet to crush Grapes and collect their juice in a
                        vat where it would ferment. The discovery of a winery is important because it is evidence that
                        Grapes have been domesticated in order to allow this large scale production.In many ancient
                        legends wine has a place. The following is an example of a Persian legend which discovered wine.
                        In summary, a woman that was a member of the King's harem was banished and in her sorrow she
                        contemplated suicide. In order to do this she drank from a barrel of grapes that was deemed
                        poison due to their fermentation. Instead she experienced intoxication from drinking wine, and
                        she informed the King of this. He became so enamored from this drink that he decreed all grapes
                        be devoted to making wine.It is without a doubt the major spread of wine was due to massive
                        trade of the commodity throughout the world, people could not resist the drink. In Egypt for
                        example, wine is said to have spread there around 3000 BC likely as a result of trade between
                        Egypt and Canaan in the Levant.</p>
