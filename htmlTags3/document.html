        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Planning for the museum began in 1998.<i>Construction started in March 2000. Upon completion, the museum
                opened on 1 October 2001.</i></p>
        <p>Studio Ghibli director <b>Hayao Miyazaki</b> designed the museum himself, using storyboards similar to
            the ones he creates for his films. The design was influenced by European architecture such as the
            hilltop village of Calcata in Italy. The museum features internal and external spiral staircases built
            from iron, interior bridges, and balconies stretching throughout the building's height. These stairways
            lead to exhibits, dead ends, and across bridges.These characteristics are meant to reflect Miyazaki's
            building designs displayed in his film work.Miyazaki's aim was to make the building itself part of the
            exhibit, and for the museum to be an uplifting and relaxing experience "that makes you feel more
            enriched when you leave than when you entered".</p>
        <p>Photography and video recording is prohibited inside the museum, because the museum is described as a
            "portal to a storybook world."<b>Hayao Miyazaki's</b> goal was also for people to experience the museum
            with their own eyes and ears.</p>
        <p>"Let's get lost together" is the museum's slogan, derived from <b>Hayao Miyazaki's</b> vision for
            visitors to immerse themselves in his imagination and film work.</p>
        <p><span style="color: red">In February 2020, the museum closed temporarily as a result of the <b>COVID-19
                    pandemi</b></span>c.The museum
            later re-opened to Mitaka residents only in July and later fully reopened in September.</p>
